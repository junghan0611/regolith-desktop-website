# Recommended Packages for New Users

## Looks

Install all the official Regolith looks:

```console
sudo apt install regolith-look-*
```

## Status Indicators

The following snippet installs status indicator packages recommended for new users:

```console
sudo apt install i3xrocks-focused-window-name i3xrocks-rofication i3xrocks-info i3xrocks-app-launcher i3xrocks-memory
```

To remove any of these indicators later, simply uninstall them from your system.  Example:

```console
sudo apt remove i3xrocks-info
```

### Laptop Battery Status

View the current battery status on a laptop:

```console
sudo apt install i3xrocks-battery
```

# Wallpaper

Most Regolith Looks provide a default desktop color or image.  The wallpaper can be set by specifying the path to the wallpaper image via the Xresources key `regolith.wallpaper.file`.

Example, assuming the file `/usr/share/backgrounds/hardy_wallpaper_uhd.png` is present:

```console
echo "regolith.wallpaper.file: /usr/share/backgrounds/hardy_wallpaper_uhd.png" >> ~/.config/regolith2/Xresources
regolith-look refresh
```

To change the image treatment (zoom, scale, etc.) of the wallpaper image, set `regolith.wallpaper.options`.  Options are: `none`, `wallpaper`, `centered`, `scaled`, `stretched`, `zoom`, `spanned`

Example:

```console
echo "regolith.wallpaper.options: zoom" >> ~/.config/regolith2/Xresources
regolith-look refresh
```

To specify a color rather than an image use the Xresource key `regolith.wallpaper.color.primary`:

```console
echo "regolith.wallpaper.file: " >> ~/.config/regolith2/Xresources
echo "regolith.wallpaper.color.primary: blue" >> ~/.config/regolith2/Xresources
regolith-look refresh
```

To specify a secondary color and gradient:

```console
echo "regolith.wallpaper.file: " >> ~/.config/regolith2/Xresources
echo "regolith.wallpaper.color.primary: blue" >> ~/.config/regolith2/Xresources
echo "regolith.wallpaper.color.secondary: green" >> ~/.config/regolith2/Xresources
echo "regolith.wallpaper.color.shading.type: vertical" >> ~/.config/regolith2/Xresources
regolith-look refresh
```

## Lockscreen Wallpaper

The lockscreen wallpaper can be managed in the same way as the desktop wallpaper.  The keys are the same as desktop wallpaper, but with `lockscreen` prefixed to `wallpaper`, like so: `regolith.lockscreen.wallpaper...`.  For example, to specify a lockscreen image:

```console
echo "regolith.lockscreen.wallpaper.file: /usr/share/backgrounds/hardy_wallpaper_uhd.png" >> ~/.config/regolith2/Xresources
regolith-look refresh
```

## Disable Wallpaper handling

If you wish to manage wallpaper externally to Regolith, simply specify empty values for wallpaper image and color:

```console
echo "regolith.wallpaper.file: " >> ~/.config/regolith2/Xresources
echo "regolith.wallpaper.color.primary: " >> ~/.config/regolith2/Xresources
```

# Status Bar Indicators

Status indicators such as CPU load, date and time, notifications, weather, and other system info can be added or removed by installing packages. For example, to show a status indicator for your laptop battery, simply run `sudo apt install i3xrocks-battery` and then refresh the session using `regolith-look refresh`. To find what indicators are available, run `apt search ^i3xrocks-` or search for `i3xrocks-` in your favorite package manager GUI, such as [Synaptic](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto). There is [more documentation available]({{< ref "/docs/howtos/add-remove-blocklets.md" >}}) for configuring status indicators, also called "blocklets".

# Looks

Colors, wallpaper, window and bar layouts and other visual factors are bundled together in Regolith and called "looks". Looks provide a simple way of changing the entire look of the desktop. Like status bar indicators, looks are packaged and are installed and removed like any other software package. By convention, Look packages use the following naming format `regolith-look-<name>`. `apt` or a GUI package manager can be used to search for available looks.  To select an installed look the keybinding {{< keys "super,alt,l" >}} presents a dialog:

![](/regolith-ilia-look-selector.png)

Alternatively, the terminal command `regolith-look` can be used to change looks and refresh the active session with the selected look. Here's an example that switches to the `gruvbox` look:

```console
apt search ^regolith-look-
[...]
regolith-look-gruvbox/unknown,now 0.4.6-1regolith amd64
[...]
sudo apt install regolith-look-gruvbox
regolith-look set gruvbox
regolith-look refresh
```

To simply install all available looks:

```console
sudo apt install regolith-look-*
```

# i3 Features

Starting with Regolith 2.0, many aspects of i3 configuration are managed via the package manager.  i3 `4.20` introduced the ability to specify include files as part of the configuration.  Regolith provides all of it's i3 configuration via these files, also called "config partials".  These packages install thier i3 config partials into `/usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d`.  By installing and removing packages, i3 configuration can be customized for specific preferences while still allowing to track upstream changes for aspects of the configuration that need not vary.  By default, when the `regolith-desktop` package is installed, these configuration elements are also installed as soft dependencies:

| Package                      | Function          |
|------------------------------|-------------------|
| regolith-i3-base-launchers   | Launch terminal and browser |
| regolith-i3-default-style    | Window behavior |
| regolith-i3-navigation       | Navigation keybindings |
| regolith-i3-networkmanager   | Network and wifi functions |
| regolith-i3-next-workspace   | Workspace utility |
| regolith-i3-resize           | Resize keybindings |
| regolith-i3-session          | Session keybindings |
| regolith-i3-unclutter        | Hide mouse cursor when unused |
| regolith-i3-user-programs    | Optionally launch user programs specified in Xresources |
| regolith-i3-workspace-config | Workspace keybindings |

Soft dependencies can be removed without causing packages that depend upon it to be removed. This means that any of the listed packages can be removed.  Users can make tweaks to configuration in a more stable manner by replacing a default configuration partial with their own version.  This can be achieved by copying the partial to be customized into `~/.config/regolith2/i3/config.d/` and removing the original file in `/usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d` via apt.  For example, to customize Workspace keybindings:

> 이 부분이 중요하다! 일단, 설치해서 동작이 되면, 키 바인딩을 수정하고 싶어 진다. 설정 파일은 나의 닷파일에 잘 보관해두면 된다. STOW로 링크를 해 놓으면 아주 좋겠다.
> 먼저 바꿀 키는 SUPER, ALT_L을 구분해서 사용하도록 하는 것이다. 워크스페이스를 방향키로 전환하면 편할 것 같다. 그러려면, 기존에 `SUPER+방향키` 매핑을 ALT로 바꿔준다.
> 그리고, 워크스페이스 전환에 SUPER 키를 사용한다.

```console
mkdir -p ~/.config/regolith2/i3/config.d
cp /usr/share/regolith/i3/config.d/40_workspace-config ~/.config/regolith2/i3/config.d/
vim ~/.config/regolith2/i3/config.d/40_workspace-config # make desired changes
sudo apt remove regolith-i3-workspace-config # removes the default version
# restart i3 or log back in
```

In this way, the unmodified config partials can continue to get updates and bug fixes without impacting user-specific configuration.

# Keybindings

The most common keybinding change is the {{< keys "super" >}} key. Regolith uses `Xresources` as the canonical source of truth for settings, which are read by various UI components. The table of `Xresources` keys open to user configuration [is available elsewhere]({{< ref "xresources" >}}). To change the default {{< keys "super" >}} binding from the "windows" key to "alt", add the following line to the file `~/.config/regolith2/Xresources`:

```toml
i3-wm.mod: Mod1
i3-wm.alt: Mod4
```

**Note**: GNOME also has it's own set of keybindings. When the Regolith session is first initialized, the conflicting GNOME keybindings are removed from the user settings. GNOME keybindings can be managed in the Regolith Settings app.

# System Management

The `regolith-control-center` app is the tool to configure locale, date, displays, networking and various other settings. Launch it via the app launcher with {{< keys "super,space" >}}, type `settings`, and hit enter to launch the app. The direct keybinding is {{< keys "super,c" >}}.  The application may also be launched from a terminal with command `regolith-control-center`.

# Further Reading

To dig deeper, find which [Howtos]({{< ref "howtos" >}}) are available, or read the [Xresources reference]({{< ref "docs/Reference/xresources.md" >}}). Become an i3 power user by reading their [user guide](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html).
